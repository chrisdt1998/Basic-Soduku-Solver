# **Brute force approach sudoku solver with pygame visualizations.**

## **Introduction:**

This repository contains a brute force approach sudoku solver with pygame visualizations. This project was purely just
for fun.

## **Learning goals:**

Initally, the sudoku solver was an exercise on Code Wars, and so I decided I wanted to visualize the results. 

## **Code structure:**

- sudoku_solver.py contains all the code. More information can be found in the documented code.
